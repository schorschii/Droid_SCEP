This app enables you to request and poll certificates from a SCEP (Simple Certificate Enrollment Protocol) server. It can be configured via MDM (Mobile Device Management) policies.

It can also be used to monitor the expiration of your personal certificates and send you a notification a couple of days before.

Additionally, it provides a manual Certificate Signing Request (CSR) creation feature and a PEM to PKCS12 converter.
